            Designing a fast, efficient sign-up process.

          <p class="case_overview">
            During the Summer Cohort for Code Louisville Program in 2022, my
            team was faced with a challenge for Cat-tastic, a fictitious social
            media app for cat enthusiasts to create and share cat-related
            content. Despite being downloaded by users, the sign-up process was
            not being completed. We were given three weeks to find a solution to
            this problem.

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>
              Many users are beginning the sign-up process on the Cat-tastic
              app, however, only 30% are successfully completing it. This
              presents a problem for both the users, as it indicates there is
              friction and frustration in the sign-up process, and the business,
              as users are potential content creators and ambassadors for
              growing a thriving social media community. The company cannot
              afford to lose a significant number of users in a competitive
              market for social media share.

          <p>
            Younger generations, such as Gen Z and Millennials, generally share
            a common sentiment that they don't like to reveal too much personal
            information. They also find that many sign-up forms take too much
            time and can be cumbersome.

          <p>
            The first challenge was that the stakeholder brief indicated that
            only 30% of users were completing the sign-up process, but it did
            not provide any previous screens for analysis. This made it
            difficult to find a solution as we had to solely rely on best
            practices for sign-ups instead of the previous app's sign-up
            process. Our program mentors acted as our stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second challenge was time constraints, as we had limited time to
            conduct user research and gather qualitative data. Additionally,
            there was not enough time to obtain significant validation data.

              Discovery: Let's Look at the Competition

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>
              After defining the problem statement to align the team, we started
              by studying the sign-up processes of other competitive social
              media apps. By examining their app screens, we noticed that the
              majority of these apps offered social media sign-up buttons for a
              quick and easy sign-up experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, when these apps did not have social media
              sign-up buttons, they had no more than a few pages with minimal
              input fields and incorporated a strong password indicator for data
              protection. They also offered options for verification. To add, we
              turned to well-respected UX organizations such as NNG to study
              best practices for sign-ups.

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>
              Due to limited time, we used quantitative data from a survey to
              gather the information we needed from users. The data revealed the
              most significant issues with the sign-up process were that it was
              often too lengthy, required too much information, and had too many
              steps involved. The main goal for users when signing up for a
              social media app was to quickly start creating, viewing, and
              sharing content.

              Due to time constraints, we created a proto-persona to represent
              our target user based on the insights gathered from the discovery
              phase. This proto-persona served as a basis for creating an
              empathy map and for making design decisions moving forward.

          <p>
            Having developed our persona, we moved on to creating an empathy map
            to gain deeper insights into the behaviors and attitudes of our
            target user when using our product. This helped us to understand
            their needs, goals, pain points, and motivations in a more
            comprehensive manner. By creating an empathy map, we were able to
            put ourselves in our user's shoes and design a more user-centered
            solution that addresses their specific needs and challenges.

          <p>
            Utilizing all of our insights gathered during the discovery phase,
            we generated some general concepts for our signup process and the
            reasoning behind them. Here is the list I compiled:

            alt="cat_userflow"
          />
          <p>
            Next, in order to arrive at a shared understanding for all team
            members on the design, we each took the ideas from the previous
            stage and created our own user flows. Afterward, we compared the
            results. The user flow I created is shown above, with my wireframe
            below.

            <p>
              As previously mentioned, the team was facing a tight deadline,
              leaving little room for thorough testing. Despite the time
              constraint, I still took the time to show the screens to
              individuals within our target user age group. The wireframe I
              designed received positive feedback and I also created an
              interactive prototype, complete with a clickable link at the
              bottom. While I am aware that there are opportunities for
              improvement, I hope to conduct more testing in the future to
              better understand a critical process for most apps.

          <div class="underline"></div>
          <p>
            After creating the wireframe and little testing, I set out to design
            my own user interface. I wanted to ensure that the design was
            familiar to potential users and followed the common signup process
            of other popular social media apps. I took into consideration the
            initial feedback received from users and used my wireframe as a
            guide throughout the design process. I made sure to keep detailed
            design rational notes throughout the process. The final result is
            showcased below.

            After the completion of the project, I reflect on the process and
            identify areas of improvement for future projects. One aspect that I
            wish I could have done differently is to gather more information
            from the stakeholders regarding the previous sign-up process. Having
            a deeper understanding of the root cause of the high abandonment
            rate would have greatly impacted our solution. However, despite this
            limitation, my team and I were still able to effectively address the
            issue and deliver strong results. As I continue to grow in my role,
            I will make sure to keep this learning experience in mind for future
            projects. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this
            project and for your attention to my work.
