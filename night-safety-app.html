            Designing an app to help reduce night time safety anxiety for young
            women.
          </h1>
          <p class="case_overview">
            Night safety app is geared toward young women, particularly in
            college. The app is designed to help users walk to their
            destinations while feeling more safe and secure. Whether walking to
            the library or the bar, NSA is designed to prevent and reduce night
            time harassment and assault crimes against women. This was a project
            for my second cohort in the Code Louisville Program. After a period
            of about 5 weeks, a team of 5, including myself, were able to get to
            the minimal viable product stage and plan to continue.

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>
              Many young adults live alone, work late shifts, and leave bars or
              places of study late at night, leaving them no choice but to walk
              to their destinations alone. The chance of becoming an assault
              victim greatly increases when traveling alone during dark hours,
              and because of this, having to walk without accompaniment often
              results in fear, anxiety, and low confidence in nighttime safety
              for these young adults.

          <p>
            Though many women in general do not feel safe traveling around at
            night, to limit scope, we decided to focus on young, female college
            students. Young women in colllege are often in situations where they
            may have to walk to a location at night such as grabbing food,
            leaving the library, walking to or from a party, etc.

            <h3>Discovery: Let's Look at the Competition</h3>
            <div class="underline"></div>
            Initially, the problem we focused on was young individuals in
            general feeling unsafe while walking to their destinations at night,
            which created a broad problem to solve. In order to limit the scope
            of the problem we used a Lean UX canvas. In the canvas, the team
            discussed who exactly we would be creating a product for. Questions
            came up such do we as a team want to focus on an individual or
            collaborative solution (parent and child), should we create a
            solution for multiple age groups or just one, and what are others in
            this niche doing to solve this issue. After discussing these
            questions, we then moved on to competitive analysis to further find
            the answers we sought.
            <p>
              For our competitve analysis, we looked at existing solutions on
              what they did well and where their where gaps within the market
              where user needs weren't being met. Primarily, we focused on apps,
              physical devices, and hybrid solutions which utilized both apps
              and physical devices. Searching app store user reviews allowed us
              to quickly get customer feedback on potential competitor
              solutions. After gathering enough data, our next step was to hear
              from potential users directly by sending out a survey.

            <p>
              In our survey we wanted to understand user feelings around
              nighttime safety and existing safety devices. We asked about their
              night transit routines, what factors contributed to unsafe
              feelings, and what they usually did to help them feel safer. We
              surveyed over fifty people, and what was quite shocking, and sad,
              was that ¼ of our respondents said they feel unsafe almost every
              day, and over ¾ of them stated they feel unsafe at least one day a
              month. Even more shocking was that, once we grouped our
              respondents by gender, nearly ¼ of all women stated they feel
              unsafe almost every night and nearly 90% feel unsafe at least once
              a month. An alarming amount of female respondents (nearly 1 in 10)
              said they will not walk anywhere alone at ANY time.

              Due to time constraints, we created a proto-persona to represent
              our target user based on the insights gathered from the discovery
              phase. This proto-persona served as a basis for creating an
              empathy map and for making design decisions moving forward.

            Next, we did some group brainstorming. Using all of our findings
            from the <b>discovery phase</b>, we came up with some
            <b>general ideas</b> to what should be included in our night safety
            app and why. For our MVP, we focused on a couple key areas. First,
            we wanted to focus on users feeling safe about walking with other
            users by implementing a required verification system. Second, we
            wanted to let users be able to quickly and easily share their
            location with their inner circle or authorities at any moment.
            Third, we wanted users to have the ability to report any unsafe walk
            situation. Last, we thought that users should be able to quickly
            find each with features such as a location map similar to Lyft.

          />
          <p>
            We then took the ideas from the previous stage, went off
            individually, created our own userflows. Afterwards, we then
            compared what each team member came up with. To the left is the user
            flow I created. We wanted to develop a
            <b>shared understanding</b> for all team members on what we would be
            designing. Below is the initial wireframe by Natalya, a team member.
            My interpretation wireframe is below Natalya's as I designed after
            viewing hers. Here we have two different approach, one in which
            Natalya design a process for users to simply join an individual or
            group walking to the same common destination, which a great
            solution. When designing my wireframe however, I asked myself, what
            if someone has to go to a destination that isn't as popular or
            common? For this reason, I chose the Uber/Lyft model for my design.
            In the end, the team decided that a hybrid of the two approach would
            work best by keeping the design I created and implementing an alert
            and screen for users traveling to a common destination.

              We set out, once again, to speak with our target users. This time,
              we shared some safety solutions we had envisioned for our walking
              app, then asked a series of questions. How long would they be
              willing to wait to be joined for a walk? Would they like the
              ability to see if a user was in fear or in need of a walk in an
              urgent situation? Would they be interested in allowing multiple
              users to join in on walks to a common location? And, how did they
              rank the importance of different features within the app? Many
              features would most certainly need a roadmap of some sort. For
              now, users how been able to view simple screen layouts and we are
              currently still getting feedback on the best direction to go in
              regarding information architecture and visual design.
